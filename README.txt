PubTator3 DATASET
===========================================================================

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PubTator3 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator3/) [1] is a web service for exploring and retrieving bioconcept and relation annotations in biomedical articles. PubTator3 provides automated annotations from state-of-the-art deep learning-based text mining systems for genes/proteins, genetic variants, diseases, chemicals, species, cell lines and the relations among the entities, all available for immediate download. PubTator3 annotates PubMed (36 million abstracts), the PMC Open Access Subset and the Author Manuscript Collection (6.3 million full text articles).  This FTP repository aggregated all the bio-entity and relation annotations in PubTator3 in BioC-XML and PubTator (tab-separated) formats. The files are expected to be updated monthly.

CONTENTS:

The entity files contain five columns as shown in below:
	i.   PMID:       PubMed abstract identifier
	ii.  Type:       i.e., gene, disease, chemical, species, and mutation
	iv.  Concept ID: Corresponding database identifier (e.g., NCBIGene ID and MESH ID)
	v.   Mentions:   Bio-concept mentions corresponding to the PubMed abstract
	vi.  Resource:   Various manually annotated resources are included in the files (e.g., MeSH and gene2pubmed)

The relation file contain four columns as shown in below:
	i.   PMID:       PubMed abstract identifier
	ii.  Type:       i.e., Association, Positive_Correlation, Negative_Correlation, Co-treatment, Drug_interaction, Comparison, Conversion, Binding
	iv.  1st concept with its entity type (e.g., Gene and Disease) and identifier (e.g., NCBIGene ID and MESH ID)
	v.   2nd concept with its entity type (e.g., Gene and Disease) and identifier (e.g., NCBIGene ID and MESH ID)
